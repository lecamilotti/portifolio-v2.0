# portifolio-v2.0


I created this second version of my portfolio in HTML, CSS, JS using dribble as a layout search tool, 
I am currently doing a Code BootCamp focused on React, TypeScript and Node I am currently creating projects that in the future I will be adding at this portfolio.
Thinking about the version 3.0 of this very same portfolio I intend create it using React with typeScript, some CSS framework as well and CMS to manage the content.
